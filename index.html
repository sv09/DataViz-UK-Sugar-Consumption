        <h2 class="title">Free Sugars Consumption in the UK</h2>
        <p class='para-text'>Free sugars is defined as all monosaccharides (carbohydrates that cannot be broken down by hydrolysis) and disaccharides (molecules having two monosaccharide residues) added to foods, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices. While the free sugars consumption in the UK has reduced since 2008 across most age groups except for the age group of 65-74 years, it is still higher than the recommended 5% intake of calories from free sugars.</p>
